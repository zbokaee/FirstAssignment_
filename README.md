:relaxed:	 In this repo, you can find my answers to unit 1 and unit 4 questions of the book Artificial Intelligence a Modern Approach by Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig.
<br/>
:slightly_smiling_face: You can also find the implementation for some searching algorithms that lie on the book, including stochastic-hill-climbing, Random Walk, MAXSAT, BFS search, 
<br/>

```diff
+ Hint: For MaxSat algorithm, you can use the file max-sat-20-90.txt.
+ Hint: For Knapsack algorithm, you can use the file knapsack-20.txt


```




The following picture is the the result of the stochastic-hill-climbingshows algorthm. Here the Response Surface of Objective Function With Sequence of Best Solutions Plotted as Silver Dots is shown.
